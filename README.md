#  ⚔️💫 Genshin Impact Tribute Website
This is a triute website for the game [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/home) by [HoyoVerse](https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/). My siblings really like this game, so I thought it would make for a cool project!


here's my favourite genshin quote:

P.S   I am really proud of the 'Nations' page, do check it out!


## Pages
--> Home page

--> Top Characters Page (divided by type of character)

--> Weapons Page (all weapon types in Genshin, with 5 examples)

--> Teyvat's Map

--> Nations Page (best one in all of website :D )

## Learnings
- a lot of new JS concepts
- a lot of teeny details of CSS properties
- structuring and executing a large project(max no. pages + content that i've ever built)
- patience (this took ~29 hours of code + ~3+ hours of finding/editing assets)



## Challenges Faced
- debugging the 'Nations' page (why did you have so many problems???)
- styling the website (managing a lot of arguments for the styles, since my siblings didn't like half the stuff i did and then i had to redo it) (also, considering that i'm the only one who doesn't play this game (high school senior + tech hobbies = no time for casual gaming), this was difficult)
- debugging the sidebar js took way more time than i'd like to admit
- finding time to complete it (hackclub's YSWS are very tempting (and distracting ;D))
