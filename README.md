#  ⚔️💫 Genshin Impact Tribute Website
This is a triute website for the game [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/home) by [HoyoVerse](https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/). Me and my siblings really like this game, so I thought it would make for a cool project!



here's my favourite genshin quote:
> IS THIS WHAT JUSTICE MEANS TO YOU? ANSWER ME, NEUVILLETTE!
> 
> ~ Vautrin (Neuvillette's Story Quest)
